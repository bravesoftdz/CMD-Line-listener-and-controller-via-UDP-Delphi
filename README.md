# UDP-Control
a program i made in highschool to essentially gain control of friends computer
UDP broadcasting that allows one to execute cmd line commands through network to client computers (windows machines). all machines have an active listener that await a command on a certain port. i also made an app for android that can act as the controller. sadly due to being unorganised when i was in highschool different versions of the program are all zipped including the server side.
